The great Outback has been known for many things but no one saw something so unique and as mezmerizing as Tame Impala. A single artist who articulates these
huge ensembles of music with multiple differnt instruments and then mixes that later on into a <em>psychedilic</em> masterpiece. and then have a band join them
 either on tour for recording.
No we are not talking about <em>psychedilic</em>, who share too many coincidences with T.I other than the vocals, which T.I seems to blend 
seemlesly into any of the songs he produces.
