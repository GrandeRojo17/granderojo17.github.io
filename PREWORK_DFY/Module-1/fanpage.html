Maybe it's something in the water or possibly related to the reverse toiletbowl water direction, whatever the case might be something is going on in 
Australia causing single artists to articulate huge ensembles of music alone and then have a band join them on tour or for recording.
No we are not talking about <em>Pilini</em>, who share too many coincidences with T.I other than the vocals, which T.I seems to blend 
seemlesly into any of the songs he produces.
